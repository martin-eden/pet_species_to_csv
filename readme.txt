Does not work in 2019!

Sorry guys, Blizz now requires passport to obtain AuthID. Fuck them.

I'll keep code locally for tinkering but this repository will be
deleted: 
  * I can't test it's current functionality
  * my account was BANNED FOREWER in WoW. Feels like medal of honour.
  * I'm tired of WoW. I've tried and saw a lot of thinkgs while I
was playing 2009/2015

Sorry for copy-paste this part from [pet_aux]. Just same reasons
applies here and I'm lazy to create separate file with explanations
and making links to it.
